    "Public Cloud services are useful tools to store and analyze documents' contents as well as to extract and process data. If you have never used a public cloud, you've probably already used: uploading documents to remote platform (some popular ones are DropBox, Google Drive, etc), transcribing an audio (after a set of interviews), copying and pasting data from webpage' images (who did not do that, right?) are some example of services that have been automated on public clouds to offer an on demand/on premises service.\n",

    "Microsoft Azure is a platform that automates and enhances a lot of the tasks that arise when dealing with storing data, machine learning and cluster computing [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

While some cognitive services are accessible from the studio, some are not so we have to poke around with code to exploit the most insteristing services for social scientists available.

To create your Azure account you will be asked to add your credentials as well as a credit card account.
